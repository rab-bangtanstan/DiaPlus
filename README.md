## Description

Diabetic patients are often required to monitor their blood glucose levels at regular intervals of time to keep it on check. Based on the type and quantity of food consumed by the patients, their blood glucose level keeps changing throughout the day.

 The blood glucose level readings are obtained using glucometer and strips with a drop of blood. The numerical readings are usually needed to be remembered in order to take correct medication .Manually keeping in track of all the readings such as writing it down can be a tedious process. Hence the DiaPlus comes in handy to record the reading in a personalized manner.

Each user is logged in through their gmail id where they can either sign up or sign in.
There are two main activities involved are the glucose level tracker and supplies page.
In the tracker page, the user can enter the time of the day (morning, afternoon,night) along with the glucose reading in numeric format.
The user can keep adding or deleting the reading as and when required. Whenever the user is logged in the details of readings will be retained in the tracker page.
The second activity involves a shopping page for important supplies required for diabetic patients.Supplies such as Glucometer strips, swabs. This functionality makes the application beneficial to the users since they could directly order the supplies through the app.
